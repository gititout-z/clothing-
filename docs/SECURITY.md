# Security Best Practices

This document outlines key security considerations for developing and deploying this application.

## 1. Manage Secrets Securely
*   **Environment Variables:** API keys (like Twilio Account SID and Auth Token) and other sensitive configuration should be managed via environment variables. Use a `.env` file for local development (ensure it's in `.gitignore`) and your hosting provider's mechanism for setting environment variables in staging/production.
*   **Secrets Management Tools:** For production, consider using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager) for an additional layer of security and control.
*   **Never hardcode secrets** in your source code.

## 2. Input Validation and Sanitization
*   **Validate Incoming Data:** All data received from external sources, such as incoming WhatsApp messages (`message_data` in `whatsapp_app/main.py`), must be rigorously validated and sanitized.
*   **Prevent Injection Attacks:** Be especially careful if using incoming data to construct database queries (SQL injection), shell commands (command injection), or HTML/XML responses (cross-site scripting - XSS). Use parameterized queries, ORMs, and appropriate escaping/encoding techniques.
*   **Type Checking:** Ensure data is of the expected type and format.

## 3. API Security (Twilio Integration)
*   **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with the Twilio API (and any other external APIs) is over HTTPS. The Twilio Python library does this by default.
*   **Least Privilege:** If creating API keys, grant them only the permissions necessary for the application's functionality.
*   **Request Validation (Twilio):** Twilio sends a signature with webhook requests (`X-Twilio-Signature`). Validate this signature to ensure requests genuinely originate from Twilio. The Twilio Python helper library provides utilities for this. This is crucial for the `handle_incoming_message` endpoint.
    *   *(Note: Full implementation of Twilio request validation is beyond this basic setup but is a critical production step.)*

## 4. Dependency Management
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update your project dependencies (`requirements.txt`) to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `pip-audit` or GitHub's Dependabot to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Pin Dependencies:** For production builds, consider pinning dependency versions (e.g., `package==1.2.3`) to ensure reproducible and stable environments. Use a tool like `pip-tools` to compile `requirements.in` to `requirements.txt`.

## 5. Error Handling
*   **Avoid Leaking Sensitive Information:** Ensure that error messages logged or sent in responses do not expose sensitive information (e.g., stack traces, internal paths, API keys). Our current logging setup is basic; for production, review log content carefully.

## 6. General Best Practices
*   Follow the principle of least privilege for all system components.
*   Regularly review and audit your codebase for security vulnerabilities.
*   Stay informed about common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
