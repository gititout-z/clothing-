    # The print statement "Recipient phone number or Twilio phone number not
    # configured..." only happens if that block is executed.  # noqa: E501

    # To test this, one would typically:
    # 1. Refactor the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block into a function,
    #    say `main.run_main_app()`.
    # 2. Call `main.run_main_app()` in the test.
    # 3. Capture stdout using `capsys` and assert its content.

    # Example (if main.py was refactored):
    #   main.run_main_app()
    #   captured = capsys.readouterr()
    #   assert "Recipient phone number or Twilio phone number not configured." in captured.out
    #   assert "To send a test message, set the TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID" in captured.out

    # Without refactoring, directly testing this print output from the
    # __main__ block when main.py is imported as a module is not
    # straightforward because the block doesn't run. The test passes
    # vacuously, indicating this part is not effectively tested.
    pass  # Placeholder for the reasons stated above and in test code comments.
